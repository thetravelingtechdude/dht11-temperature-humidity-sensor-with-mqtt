# dht11-temperature-humidity-sensor-with-mqtt

This code helps interface the DHT11 sensor (Temperature and Humidity sensor) with a Raspberry Pi device. The DHT11 sensor collects and returns the temperature and humidity values to the Raspberry Pi and these values are sent to the cloud via the MQTT protocol.
